This program displays a color-encoded sexigesimal(binary) clock showing the time in two ways. One is by reading user input from stdin in HH:MM:SS format, military time. 
The other way is by displaying the current time every second. 
When the USR1 signal is received from another terminal window, the clock toggles to 12hr mode and reverses the colors of the white colons
and the black background. 

To run the program to show the current time:
make all
make run

To run the program to show the desired input time:
./clock
 
To exit the program:
^C
     *note: the program will exit if time is not entered in HH:MM:SS, military time.
